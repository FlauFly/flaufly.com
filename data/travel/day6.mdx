At the morning I was anxiously waiting for information on how to proceed and when everything will start. When I got it I decided that I have a little bit time in the morning so I went to the other beach here, Thangassery Beach with beautiful picturesque scenery of some ruins alongside pink flowers growing nearby and huge amount of birds flying between it and the sea - other than crows I noticed cheels, a lot of them, and it was amazing to see them up close after reading about them in The Wildings series.

After eating something I hurried to my room to prepare. Cleaning, treating blisters/rashes on my feet with creams and plasters and the most difficult part. How the heck am I suppose to wear mundu? I launched YouTube tutorials and tried to reproduce it, but quickly I became frustrated and started to panic a little. In the end I started to get the hang of it. But then when I felt that it keeps nicely on me and looks properly, I discovered that leg movement is very hard. How do you even move in that? Maybe I didn't tie it properly? But it looked like I did everything like in YouTube and it looked properly. With some practice I discovered that I can move a little bit more than it seemed at the beginning and I also discovered some tricks when I hold up parts of it a little and it increases leg movement a lot. 

After dressing up I eagerly waited long until her brother-cousin came to pick me up. Finally I reach first function of marriage. When we arrived I met Tini finally, professional cameraman and photographer on us recording it. It was nice to meet again, somehow familiar face was reassuring, because then came rollercoaster of introductions and welcomes. Tini said she can't help me most of the time so she referred to her friends to help me in anything. It was overwhelming in a way that it wasn't since [[Day 1 (Friday, 20.12.2024)|Day 1]], but in definitely more positive sense.

It was one of these functions visible on movies where people come and go, mostly coming for photo shoot with the bride (and the groom, when he was there) accompanied with some food and chatting. Even I have been photographed with the bride while feeding her something sweet by hand. There were some mixture of celebrating Christmas, with the "Merry Christmas". It was clearly bride's side of family function, while groom and his side came only for a while. People were interested in me wearing mundu and kurta and speaking very limited Malayalam.

Due to professional cameramen I didn't feel pressure to record too much on my own, but when bride's sisters - dark skinned beauties - had some little dance prepared, I couldn't help, but grab my phone and record it. I learned later on (although it's possible that Tini mentioned that long time ago) that her mother have 7 siblings (or she's one of 7 siblings). So there's a lot of brothers and sisters of that side of family.

First part with photoshoot was more calmed down, cute even. But when photoshoots finished and most guests left, there have been wild dancing part. It was amazing to dance among them, people became very tired, but didn't stop easily. 

When people were seriously tired and most guests already left, I had a little bit time to talk with Nirosha - one of dark skinned sisters. I taken care to write down their name down - also twins Melina and Melisa. Otherwise these names would slip through my mind too quickly and I wanted to remember at least some of them. Nirosha was very open and charming. It's difficult to really read people, because people here are really open in general. She complimented my hair, but I replied I think hers are more beautiful. She wanted to take photo of us both so I used the opportunity and asked about same, but with my phone also. When she queried me about my Malayalam at the end I said that I learned some phrases from songs also - like "karutha penne" ("dark girl"), which made her burst into laughter.

It was late and most people already left so someone (probably he was one of brothers) taken me to my place. My head was buzzing with emotions so I didn't go to sleep immediately, but when I distracted myself a little with some tv programs skipping I decided I'm actually tired and time to go to sleep.
