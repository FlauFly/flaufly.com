Time to leave Kochi and Green Woods Bethlehem and go to Kollam. Ride on the bus to Kollam was a little bit exhausting and while we traveled through Kerala I tried to register things special along the way, but things passed too quickly for me to either register it through photo or it properly sink in to my mind. Instead I got mosaic of locations and impressions. I wasn't exactly sure how the route looks like on a map. Do we move all the time along the coast? The only city that was clearly noticeable was Alleppey / Alappuzha. 

When I managed to leave my bags in my room I went and spent rest of the day on the beach. Waves here are so strong and beach (usually) so steep that when you're standing in one point, one wave could not reach you, but the next one will hit you and with the strong force cover your legs almost to knees. It seems that a lot of people drowned here so it was forbidden to swim here. There's apparently forbidden to make some big celebrations here, but it's hard to tell what that means. There were again like blend and mosaic of impressions, encounters with people and experiences. But all of that was like a distraction really. My friend went to hospital again and it went to be defining feature of the day. I didn't even manage to meet her.

I thought about going to the midnight mass, because it's hallmark of Christmas Eve celebration here, they don't have kind of feast as we have in Poland. But I returned from the beach too late, I was tired, not really clean enough and didn't have time to prepare otherwise. It wasn't really how I imagine this day, but it wasn't completely bad.

Either way, I really hope that everything will properly start tomorrow.
