How do you imagine I have been spending my last day before my trip started? Probably you thought of something natural, like for example, me cutting anti-steal plastic boxes for electronics with hacksaw. 
Wait, what?! 

Okay, I admit. It's not exactly the most obvious image someone could conjure as an answer to this question. I didn't provide myself with luxury of something like casual, but careful recheck of my baggage, without haste. But let me backtrack a little bit. 

I didn't have exactly much of luck lately with things. In last 2 weeks my bike, ebook reader and electric shaver (and probably other things I don't remember) broken down and they are objects which I use all the time. At least broken to such degree that they were not usable and I didn't have time left to fix them or buy replacements. Everything accumulated and I didn't properly even started to pack. 

Few days ago I went to do some shopping before the trip and I bought powerbank and SD card in big shop. Out of habit I went for automated cash register instead of going to cashier. But I struggled to scan something so cashier came and helped me scan it either way. This little detail will be significant later. Out of habit again, I used receipt only to open exit gate and I threw it away as soon as I left. Probably I should keep it for a while when buying something like electronics, but old habits die hard.

I didn't pay much attention to them immediately, because there were other matters to think about. But day or two later I tried to open them and it came out it's quite hard. I expected that there has to be some trick, but I couldn't find it so I made photos and sent them to my engineer friend asking for help. His first answer was in the form of a question - "why do you have powerbank in an anti-steal box?" That was the moment I understood that I fumbled big time.

He explained that normally cashier should open it for me with magnet, but I went to automated cash register, ignorant that this box is not just some regular packaging. But there was cashier helping me scan it, why didn't he realize? Regardless, I didn't have receipt so I couldn't go and ask them to open them now. 

So what are my options? I asked. My friend said that either I can do it civilized way with strong magnet or like barbarian with hacksaw. But I didn't have any of it! So instead of going shopping and focusing on finishing touches with normal stuff, what was I looking to buy few days before my big travel? Hacksaw and some working gloves, because I couldn't really find magnets.

I started to feel that I am the third neighbor from classical Czechoslovakian cartoon Pat a Mat. Whatever little problem I had it escalated into inevitable disaster. Cutting thick plastic boxes with hacksaw was just cherry on top, but there were other smaller busywork to do this last day. 

I have had to print e-visa copy (because obviously I didn't do it earlier), but queue was enormous and I waited for at least an hour. I didn't want to go looking for other print shop, because I waited there so long already. I was looking also for little metal rod to open pocket for SIM card, just in case, I will need new SIM card in India. But no phone shop had it so I decided to buy some clippers, but I couldn't find them anywhere either. Out of frustration I bought box of needles. Even though at first I worried that their pointy end can break the button, but at this point I was too frustrated and too tired to really care. If it wasn't enough, I cut myself during shaving (remember broken electric shaver?) - I didn't shave myself with regular shavers so long that it was very predictable outcome. Oh, and I wanted to get at least a little bit of rupees in cash, but two currency exchange shops didn't have them. Second one claimed that first one I checked have it - but I was fed up with all of that and I just wanted to return home finally.

I was finishing packing at night, that's right, please don't judge me, I'm already tired. I didn't sleep whole night, because my train to Krak√≥w (where I start my flight) was leaving 5:29 and I was afraid that I will oversleep if I go after everything finally will be done. Even considering that mom promised to call me and wake me up, I didn't want to tempt my fate. 

That was my -1st day of trip, I hope that you enjoyed the lecture and eagerly wait for more.
