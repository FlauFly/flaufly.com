Today was the day of moving to Alappuzha (Alleppey) and I decided that the easiest and most interesting will be train. Station was literally in very close proximity to the hostel so there were no hassle going there. 

I got the ticket to Alappuzha, but I didn't understand if I got some sit or not and how to read what's written on the ticket. On the ticket, seller written S6 and as it came out after asking, it meant that I should go to S6 compartment, but I wouldn't have any specific seat. It was slight problem moving in train with my baggage and orient myself with how things work. Whole compartment had sleeper seats above regular seats so there were multiple people just laying above. As I am used to putting baggage in trains at the top in Poland, here I had space below my seat. Someone pointed me that there were newly freed seat at the window and I should use it to see things as foreigner. Multiple sellers were going around compartments all the time with coffee, chai, snacks, whole ready meals like biryani. Interesting fact, despite many warnings, people travel with opened doors, often standing just at the door while train is moving. I didn't see it during highest speed, but it was definitely happening when train was close to station. 

Travel was relatively short and actually quite pleasant. At first I didn't want to take any tuk tuk, because my new homestay was relatively close, but with my suitcase and its broken one wheel completely (suitcase was so bad idea, I don't know why I even agreed to that) and being slightly tired I agreed to go with it. Later on when I can leave my baggage I can go with long walks on foot. 

Homestay looked exactly as much hippie as its name "Peace and love beach stay" suggested. It's colorful, just at the beach and full of hippie hinduistic imagery. I got the room with the doors just at the front, facing the beach, so close to the ocean. It's in a way wild that such a place in European country would go as some sort of premium, but here it is budget location.

I decided that I will go with the suggestion of the owner and go tomorrow for half a day trip on the boat to the backwaters. I didn't want rest of the day to go for waste so I go out to reach the harbor on my own. I saw all these beautiful houseboats which looked quite luxurious inside. Someone tried to convince me for a ride and I decided to at least orient myself with the prices. As it seems, it's an expensive deal, especially for single person and they offer usually ride with night over on the boat. Well, in the end it's called houseboat and there are rooms to sleep on it. I wondered if there are no bigger cruises where I could just go among multiple people instead of going with something crazy like paying for whole houseboat on my own. I decided that I'll simply go tomorrow for a ride suggested by homestay, because it's affordable and then I'll see what to do next.

I returned long way round through alleyways of Alappuzha to the beach and then homestay. I must admit that these random walks around alleyways are interesting for me, especially after changing the city. At the homestay I went for the rooftop when homestay guests, all Europeans where sitting and chatting. This place really have some hippie vibe. 

After some time I returned down to my room, but there water was finishing in pipes so I managed to only clean feet a little bit. It was late and I didn't know if I should wake up owner. I went to bed and texted a little bit before going to sleep. I woke up and I thought someone was running water in room next door, but it came out that water generally returned and I turned it on during my attempts earlier.

Little bit vague day, but I was excited for the next day and seeing backwaters up close finally.
